LinearEquation class
Instance Variables:
    private int x1 - Represents first x-coordinate
    private int y1 -  Represents first y-coordinate
    private int x2 -  Represents second x-coordinate
    private int y2 - Represents second y-coordinate
    private double newX -  represents the newly inputted x-value

Constructors:
    public LinearEquation(int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2, double newX) - Accepts the x and y values for each corresponding coordinate point inputted

Methods:
    public double calcDeltaX()
    - This method with find the difference of x-values

    public double calcDeltaY()
    - This method will find the difference of the y-values

    public double calcYInt()
    - This method will solve for the Y-intercept by finding the difference between y1 and slope * x1
    - This method will return the Y-intercept as a double

    public String displaySIForm()
    - This method will use the values of the slope (as fraction) and Y-intercept to display the Slope Intercept Form and return a string

    public double calcDistance()
    - This method will calculate the distance between the points using the methods calcDeltaX() and calcDeltaY()
    - This method will return the distance as a double

    public void toString()
    This method will call the methods above and display all relevant information about this
    instance including:
    - X and Y coordinate information
    - Slope as a fraction (calcDeltaY()/calcDeltaX())
    - Y-intercept
    - Slope Intercept Form equation
    - Distance between points

    public findNewX(int num)
    - This value will change the variable newX to the newly inputted parameter.

    public double calcY()
    - This method will calculate the y value of a given x by substituting the x value into the slope intercept form
    - This method will return the new y value as a double

EquationRunner.java
    Step 1: Ask user to enter first coordinate point
    Step 2: Ask user to enter second coordinate point
    Step 3: Initiate string variables firstPair and secondPair
    Step 4: Initiate int variables, x1, y1, x2, y2
    Step 5: Set x1 and x2 to integers: substring(1, index(,)) of respective coordinate points and Integer.parseInt()
    Step 6: Set y1 and y2 to integers: substring(index(,) + 1, length() - 1) of respective coordinate points and Integer.parseInt()
    Step 7: Pass the values into the constructor with 4 parameters
    Step 8: Print toString() method
    Step 9: Ask user to enter a random x value
    Step 10: Initiate double newX and set it to the input
    Step 11: Pass the value using findNew() method
    Step 12: Print the new Y-value
